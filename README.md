# Simple Web-Based Digital Clock

This is a project I thought of because any digital clocks I looked at online just had too much garbage on them, so I thought of this sleek digital clock design. It might seem simple, but deeper down, there are many aspects of this clock that make it so unique.

## Features:

- In the top right corner, there is a cog wheel which can be pressed to open an array of different buttons to customize the clock (like 24-hour or 12-hour, and choosing the theme color).
- When pressing “D”, the “date” section will change from long format (Friday, October 11, 2022) to dd/mm/yy (11/10/22) and vice versa.
- When pressing “S”, a schedule will appear at the top of the screen (configurable in script.js) and will disappear when pressing “S” once more.

## Tutorial:

First, download the code in this repository by pressing the green button that says "<> Code" at the top of the screen. After pressing the green button, click "Download Zip".

After downloading the zip file, unzip it by right clicking the file, then selecting "Extract All...". Open the folder that has been extracted from the zip file and delete "README.md" and "Images". Open "Digital Clock", then open "index.html".
